# Assignment 7: Defining Functions

This weekâ€™s assignment will help you practice creating and using functions to
structure your code efficiently. You will revisit a couple of old friends,
adding new capabilities and leveraging custom functions to make them easier to
understand and maintain.

## Learning Objectives

1. Develop functions to handle calculations and input validation.
2. Learn how to structure programs using multiple functions.
3. Practice working with user inputs, conditional logic, and exception handling.
4. Test programs to ensure correct functionality and handle invalid inputs gracefully.

## Assignment Structure

The assignment is structured into the following exercise folders under the root
folder `assn-7-yourusername/`:

- `01-bridge`
- `02-calcagain`

Each folder contains specific tasks that you need to complete.

## Assignment Completion Procedures

You will complete and submit this assignment in a similar way to prior
assignments. To avoid cluttering up this README with the same instructions each
time, they have been broken out into a separate file. Please reference
[PROCEDURES.md](PROCEDURES.md) to see the details if you have forgotten.

In summary:

  1. Complete the code for each exercise per the instructions
  2. Run the scripts to test and debug
  3. Execute the automated tests to ensure expected functionality

When finished, do not forget to:

1. Commit and Sync:
    - Switch to version control tab
    - Stage all changed files
    - _**Enter a commit message**_
    - Click Commit
    - Click Sync
2. Validate your submission in GitHub
3. Submit the final commit ID in D2L
